<h1><font color="gold" style="bold">Biography</font></h1>
                	<p>"Life is hard but it fair to me tough titty but the milk is  free, they ask me how I'm doing said I can't complain if I did they probably  wouldn't listen anyway."</p>
                    <p>Elevating words on life <font color="silver">from Missin'</font> Link.  Originally from the distressed streets of <font color="silver">Cleveland, Ohio</font>  Missin' Link belts out seductive, provoca<font color="silver">tive, and inspirati</font>onal tunes influenced  by R&amp;B, Funk, and <font color="silver">Hip Hop to rock your</font> body.  The boldness of his music reveals wh<font color="silver">at  crosses everyone's </font>mind but only a few dare to say.</p>
                    <p>Starting from h<font color="silver">umble beginnings as stu</font>dent at Central State  University, Missin' <font color="silver">Link and a few  friends</font> were free styling in his kitchen at Maple Vie<font color="silver">w apartments in F</font>airborn, Ohio.  Due to numerous complime<font color="silver">nts and requests </font>for more music, he continued to write an<font color="silver">d record. As a result, he </font>created Hell's Kitchen Entertainment.  <font color="silver">In efforts, to make </font>himself and his team more  professional and <font color="silver">marketable he drop</font>ped the "Hell's" off because he felt it was  a "neg<font color="silver">ative connotation"</font>. Thus, The Kitchen Entertainment was born.</p>
                    <p>Having been in  the music business a little over ten years, Missin' Link continues to remain a  breath of fresh air. His live shows have been reviewed as "Tantalizing" and  "Old school smooth with a new school kick". Ultimately, if you have never had  the "Missin Link Experience" stop half stepping and "GET THERE!"    </p>
